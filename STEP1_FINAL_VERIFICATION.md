  - Live deployment verified

#### 2. ✅ Technology Stack Justification
- **Status**: DOCUMENTED & DEPLOYED
- **Evidence**:
  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (justified for performance & maintainability)
  - Backend: Node.js v20.19.5, Express.js (justified for scalability)
  - Database: PostgreSQL on Neon Cloud (justified for ACID compliance)
  - Security: JWT, bcrypt, HTTPS/TLS (justified for HIPAA compliance)

#### 3. ✅ Role-Based Access Control Matrix
- **Status**: FULLY DEFINED
- **Evidence**:
  - 10+ user roles documented (Super Admin to Patient)
  - Hierarchical permission structure
  - Module-level access controls defined
  - Data access boundaries specified

#### 4. ✅ Phased Project Timeline
- **Status**: COMPLETED AS PLANNED
- **Evidence**:
  - Phase 1 (MVP): ✅ Delivered (Week 1-4)
  - Phase 2 (Enhanced): ✅ Delivered (Week 5-8)
  - Phase 3 (Advanced): ✅ Delivered (Week 9-12)
  - All deliverables completed on schedule

### Live System Verification:
